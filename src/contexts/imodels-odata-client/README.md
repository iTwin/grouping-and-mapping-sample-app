# iModels OData Client

This client for the [iModels OData API](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels-odata/overview/) was written for the purposes of this course. In practice, any publicly available OData v4 client library can be pointed to the Reporting Platform APIs and it is up to you, the developers, to decide whether or not to use an off-the-shelf library, copy this source code, or write something of your own. [Detailed documentation on the OData v4 protocol is available online](https://www.odata.org/documentation/). For best results, we encourage you to use an off-the-shelf OData library instead of writing one by hand or using the example provided here for greater stability and support. We don't intend to maintain or optimize this example client beyond the scope of the accreditation course - it is not suitable for reuse in production applications.
